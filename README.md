Here GitHub Actions are used to automate the devops processes.
Created workflow and runners that act as environments to run on.
Then used elements of workflows Jobs, steps and YAML language.
Created a basic work flow manually then triggered a workflow by pushing code from visual studio to show continous integation.
Then used two ways of creating webapp worlfow to azure app service
First by creating via azure work flow service from the deployment center on azure app service
Then composing workflow file manually from github
